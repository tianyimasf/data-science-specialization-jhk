\section{Additional Course Specific Notes:}{
\itemize{
\item Folders for each week have been created for better data management and  \cr 
user experience.
\item This course is for you learn and practice how to successfully integrate \cr 
tools used by data scientists.
\item No major coding required in this course.
\item In Week 3, ensure your SSH keys are correctly entered in RStudio, as errors \cr 
here will lead to unsuccessful linking of your GitHub account and RStudio. \cr 
\item R is quite picky when running commands. For example, install.packages() is \cr 
correct but install.package() is not. Watch out for these subtle differences! \cr 
\item GitHub has a steep learning curve, but once integrated with RStudio, it will \cr 
make your life much easier! Version control is one of the aspects overlooked by \cr 
many programmers.
\item If anything is unclear from the course content, please go through the \cr 
Discussion board and see if your question has been answered before. If you are \cr 
having issues with the RStudio lab environment, please contact Coursera through \cr
